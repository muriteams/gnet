The goal of gnet is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of gnet from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gnet")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, cache=TRUE}
library(ergmito)
library(gnet)

# A random sample of networks
set.seed(12)
nets <- list(ergmito::rbernoulli(3), ergmito::rbernoulli(4))

# Are the edgecounts random??
fun <- function(g, y) mean(sapply(g, function(z) summary(z~edges)) - y)

mytest <- struct_test(nets ~ edges + balance, y = runif(2), R=1000, stat=fun)
```

```{r printing}
mytest
```


```{r hist}
# Looking at the distribution
hist(mytest$t, breaks=10, col="gray", border="transparent")
abline(v = mytest$t0, col="steelblue", lwd=2, lty="dashed")
```
